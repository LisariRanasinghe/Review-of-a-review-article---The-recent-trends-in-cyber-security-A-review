# Review-of-a-review-article---The-recent-trends-in-cyber-security-A-review
I was first drawn to red teaming because it was the first time I had ever heard about it. At first, I struggled to find any good articles with a JUFO rating on the topic. Then I tried searching for penetration testing, but it was also difficult to find relevant sources. Finding quality articles on penetration testing and red teaming was challenging in the beginning. Finally, I searched for “cybersecurity,” and the article Recent Trends in Cybersecurity: A Review came up, which had a JUFO rating of 1, as shown in the picture. The review article was published in 2022, which is quite new. The review article seemed interesting, well-organized, and included helpful figures to explain the concepts. That’s why I chose this review article to focus on. I have answered the 3 questions in bullet points below.
Key areas that are being researched.
•	Classification of cyber attacks
Cryptographic attacks, reconnaissance attacks, active/passive, phishing, malware and quantum related attacks.
•	Cryptographic standards and algorithms 
Symmetric and asymmetric algorithms
•	Recent advancements in cryptography such as modified and hybrid encryption schemes, Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and certificate-based encryption.
•	Advanced key management schemes: variable length keys and distributed key generation.
•	Quantum Cryptography 
Explains regarding Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), BB84 and other quantum protocols and Impact of quantum computing on classical cryptography
•	Security threats and challenges such as side-channel attacks, ransomware and hardware-based and implementation-level vulnerabilities.
What’s widely agreed upon?
•	Researchers agree that a single security solution is not sufficient. Therefore, they believe that cybersecurity must rely on a combination of cryptography, key management, frameworks and awareness is essential.
•	Many studies show that quantum computing is a huge threat to classical cryptographic algorithms. 
•	Key management is critical just as the encryption algorithm itself.
•	Most researchers agree that the traditional cryptographic algorithms are becoming less secure over time due to increasing computer power and new attack techniques.
What are the open questions?
•	How can existing encryption algorithms remain effective in the future, especially with the development of quantum computing?
•	How to develop advanced cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to new attack techniques such as quantum attacks?
•	How can organizations keep their systems secure when attackers are developing new tools and techniques each and every day.
•	How soon will quantum cryptography become practical and affordable in the real world?
